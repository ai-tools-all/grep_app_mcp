when adding a new tool, 

1. implement the core functionality in core as functions / interface / that can be re-used
2. the tools sections provides an interface for the fastmcp server to epxose those tools
3.  include examples on inputs that are ideally needed. see if fastmcp spec allows for that 

when done implementing the tool, use add-notes workflow to add the notes about what you learnt in the folder.
